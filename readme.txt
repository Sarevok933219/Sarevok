A simple, web based configuration portal for WireGuard. The portal uses the WireGuard wgctrl library to manage existing VPN interfaces. This allows for seamless activation or deactivation of new users, without disturbing existing VPN connections.

The configuration portal supports using a database (SQLite, MySQL, MsSQL or Postgres), OAuth or LDAP (Active Directory or OpenLDAP) as a user source for authentication and profile data.
